# Library_management_system

Developed a console-based Library Management System to manage book and member records. The system allowed for adding and searching books, issuing and returning books, and managing member information using basic file handling and OOP concepts in C++.

Key Features:

1. Book Management: Added features to insert, search, and display books with relevant information (book ID, title, author).
2. Member Management: Implemented functionality to add, display, and manage library members.
3. Issue & Return System: Enabled tracking of book issue and return statuses with real-time updates.
4. User-Friendly CLI: Designed an intuitive command-line interface to perform all operations.
5. Object-Oriented Design: Applied OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction through the use of classes for Book, Member, and Library to handle real-world scenarios.
